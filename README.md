👋 Hi Everyone! I'm Prashanth from Tamil Nadu, India.

👨‍💻 I am a full-stack .NET developer currently working as a software developer at QompassNow in Kochi, Kerala, India.

🚀 As a full-stack developer, I specialize in using a combination of ASP.NET Core, C#, MVC, WPF, Web API, and JavaScript frameworks like React to create powerful and responsive web applications.

💻 With ASP.NET Core, MVC, and Web API, I build robust backend systems and web applications, ensuring efficient data management, seamless API integrations, and secure data communication. React allows me to create dynamic and efficient web interfaces, while WPF enables me to develop rich desktop applications with intuitive user interfaces.

⚙️ My expertise in Entity Framework ensures optimized and secure data handling, and SQL Server is my go-to database for reliable data storage.

🔄 I also utilize design patterns and microservices architecture to ensure that my applications are scalable, maintainable, and easily extendable.

📚 With my extensive knowledge in these technologies, I can create high-quality, scalable, and user-friendly web and desktop apps that meet your business needs.

🔧 Whether you need a new application developed from scratch or want to enhance an existing system, I have the skills and experience to help you achieve your goals.

📩 Contact me today to discuss your project, and let's build a successful application together!

🙏 Thank you for taking the time to get to know me.
